description: EXPLAIN how work multi-tenant model with organization
globs: *.ts, *.tsx
alwaysApply: false
---
## Context

* The application defines a multi-tenant model
* The multi-tenant model name is `Organization`
* Every table must be linked to `Organization` and the user can be a member of it.
* The plan and payment is always linked to the `Organization`
* The organization is defined in [better-auth.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema/better-auth.prisma)

## Methods

- You must always use organization for resources. Everything must be linked to an organization, not a user.

- To get an organization, you can use `getCurrentOrg` or `getRequiredCurrentOrg` function, or their cached versions `getRequiredCurrentOrgCache`.

```ts
import { getCurrentOrg, getRequiredCurrentOrg } from "@/lib/organizations/get-org";
import { getRequiredCurrentOrgCache } from "@/lib/react/cache";

const org = await getCurrentOrg();
// or for required (throws if not found)
const org = await getRequiredCurrentOrg();
// or cached version
const org = await getRequiredCurrentOrgCache();
```

The `cache` version avoids making the request multiple times.

## Rules

You must always include the organization inside Prisma queries to avoid getting data from other organizations:

```ts
const org = await getRequiredCurrentOrgCache();

const tags = await prisma.tag.findMany({
  where: {
    // Verify the organization
    organizationId: org.id,
  }
});
```

## Subscription

The subscription is inside the current org:

```ts
import { getPlanLimits } from "@/lib/auth/stripe/auth-plans";
import { getRequiredCurrentOrgCache } from "@/lib/react/cache";

const org = await getRequiredCurrentOrgCache();
const subscription = org.subscription;

// Get the plan limit
const maxMembers = getPlanLimits(org.subscription?.plan ?? "free").members;
```

## Roles

The roles are defined in [auth-permissions.ts](mdc:src/lib/auth/auth-permissions.ts) with the permissions.
