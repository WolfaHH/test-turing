## Context

- The library used for handling authentication, organization, and subscription is `Better-Auth`.

## Config files

- [auth.ts](mdc:src/lib/auth.ts) is the main config file. We use `auth` only on the server
- [auth-client.ts](mdc:src/lib/auth-client.ts) is the client-side config file. We use `authClient` only on the client
- [auth-permissions.ts](mdc:src/lib/auth/auth-permissions.ts) is the file that defines all the permissions for our application
- [auth-plans.ts](mdc:src/lib/auth/stripe/auth-plans.ts) defines the plans of the application
- [auth-org.ts](mdc:src/lib/auth/auth-org.ts) contains helpers for the organization
